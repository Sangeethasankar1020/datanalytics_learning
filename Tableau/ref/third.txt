calculations 

1) Analysis - grand total 
2) mark - sales - quick table calculations - create a percentage of total 

3) order date in column , sales in row ( marks - bar chart ) and second sales as quick tabel calculation - percentage of total 

- Table related calculations - triangle 
- normal is data base related calculation 

4) we can duplicate sheet as crosstab we can create table with percentage 
- create grand total by analysis - column grand total 

- we can create a subtotal also by analysis 

5) running total 

- order date column sales in sales made as month wise 

- sales in row change into discrete 

- row sales - quick table calculations                                          
- date in column and two sales in rows select - second sales - running total 


Compute 

1) category , sub category in row , two sales in column change one as percentage of total 

- analysis - sub total and grand total 

- compute using - subcategory - we get how much the sub category is contributing , we can calcualte using catgeory also 

- then create as cross tab for table we can clearly see detailed info 

- order date - row  , category in column , sales in text - change as percentage of total , analysis - show column grand total  , show row grand total 

- year wise sales we can see , but i want category wise  - sales - compute using - table down /table 


conditional formatting 

1) sub catgeory in row , sales in text and sort 

2) calculated field  - index ()

3) change index into decrete and then put in table

4) calculated field - top n  

index < = 10

5) put top n in colour - we can exclude and filter 

6) we can create a bottom 

- last () - calculated field - change into discrete 
- create a calculated field - bottom N 
- last < = 5
- put bottom in colour 

7) we can create a top 5 or bottom 5
- index < = 5 or last < = 5
